This is the master branch of the source code that is used to build Portal for Binusmaya 5:

We admit that it is messy and a lot of improvement can be made, but due to the low number of people working on the app, the progress will surely be slow.

We will provide better documentation and try to improve our source code readability in the future.

We are also building a way to track and coordinate the development of this app through Trello:
