Portal for Binusmaya 5

This is no longer the master branch of the source code that is used to build Portal for Binusmaya 5:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.directdev.portal . Newest version now lives in https://github.com/chrisep8/Kingfish doe to the full rewrite with kotlin that we have just done recently.

We admit that it is messy and a lot of improvement can be made, but due to the low number of people working on the app, the progress will surely be slow.

We will provide better documentation and try to improve our source code readability in the future.

We are also building a way to track and coordinate the development of this app through Trello:

We will put all pull request into our consideration. You can email us at directdev.mobile@gmail.com if you have any question.
